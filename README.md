Development:

Creating this was a quite a daunting task for me.
I found myself having to keep reviewing JS concepts as I found I forgot almost everything
from the lessons leading up to this. I found the best way to approach the problem for me was working on each part as a smaller problem, rather than thinking of the whole picture, then patching it all together at the end.


What's left?
More styling,
learning to do the same thing with DRY-er code.
